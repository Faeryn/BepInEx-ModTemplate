# BepInEx ModTemplate

This script generates a BepInEx mod. The folder structure conforms to my ModPacker's requirements, so it can be used to install or publish the mod.  
WARNING: This script is in a very early/PoC stage and may break in unexpected ways. Use at your own risk!

Note: No SideLoader support (yet), you will have to do that manually after generating the project.
